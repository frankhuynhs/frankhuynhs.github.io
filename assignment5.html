            <h1>Assignment 5: Talking to the web!</h1>
            <p>"Create a webpage with p5.js that interacts with data that’s coming from your arduino over serial. You must use at least two sensors, Serial.print, and p5.js."
            <strong><p>Talking to the web demo:</p></strong>
            <p><img src="talk.gif" width=700></a></p>
            <p>This is a gif showing how the circuit works when assembled. There are two sets of circles moving across the plane. The higher set of circles move up/down based on the movement of the joystick and the lower set of circles move up/down based on the brightness of the environment from the photoresistor.</p>
          </br>
          </br>
            <strong><p>Circuit diagram:</p></strong>
            <p><img src="talk-circuit.jpg" width=700></a></p>
            <p>The system has two parts where they both share 5V power and a common ground but A0 connects to the joystick and A1 connects to a photoresistor to interact with data from the arduino over serial and display it on a web browser via p5.js framework.</p>
          </br>
          </br>
            <strong><p>Schematic and Calculations:</p></strong>
            <p><img src="talk-schematic.jpeg" width=500></a></p>
            <p>This is a schematic of my circuit. Considering that the range of resistance can vary for the photoresistor, an additional resistor is needed to prevent short circuiting and fully ground the circuit.</p>
            <p> V = IR </p>
            <p> 5V = 200mA (R) </p>
            <p> R = 5V/0.2A </p>
            <p> R = 25Ω </p>
            <p>While the minimimum resistance needed to prevent the board from frying is 25Ω, I used a 10kΩ resistor just to be safe.</p>
            <p>In addition, I did map my values from the joystick and photoresistor. I mapped values 0-1023 from the joystick and photoresistor to a range of 0-255 so changes are better translated in the interactive display.</p>
